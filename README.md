# IPPDOCLINT

ippdoclint is a linter program to check common printing file formats for any structural or content errors. This repo has been forked from istopwg/ippsample and will be used for committing changes to tools/ippdoclint.c as part of my Google Summer of Code 2018 project on behalf of OpenPrinting. The original README of this repo has been copied to README_ORIG.md
